Hello. I am Connor Grady. I am a new software developer.

I have been working as a Controls Engineer and Machine Vision Engineer for a few different companies over the past 5 years. Mainly working with Automotive manufacturers. I am taking an online bootcamp to learn the skills to work as a software developer.
