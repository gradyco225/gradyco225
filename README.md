# About Me & What I've Worked On
Hello. I am Connor Grady. I am a software developer and a gamer with over 7 years of vision system integration and controls engineering experience in the automotive industry. My favorite thing in this world is cool technology. Ever since I was a kid I was playing with and dismantling every toy/game/gadget I could get my little hands on. I wanted to figure out how they worked (and discovered what made them not). So far my career in technology has brought me to many places and I've seen a bunch of different ways to make things work.

As a machine vision engineer I used industrial cameras to inspect the quality of automotive components for countless factories at the Big 3 US manufacturers. Using Cognex and Matrox machine vision cameras, I developed applications inspecting wheel & tire, engine components, and final assembly. Our systems were inspecting thousands of vehicles and automotive components daily.

Then as a Controls Engineer I worked using Allen Bradley PLCs and Fanuc and ABB robotics to improve, maintain, and support Tier 1 automotive suppliers. I was the one called upon when things went wrong. I often needed to think quick on my feet and work intelligently in order to keep production running. Working as a controls engineer has taught me so much about technology, being a team player, fighting through adversity, and critical thinking skills.

In the fall of 2023 I enrolled in a Java Full Stack Developer Bootcamp hosted by Tech Elevator providing 800+ hours of development education and application. While there I learned about about a ton including Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), E/R diagrams, and Integration Testing.

Tech Elevator is a 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp learning how to create dynamic web-based software systems using Java providing 800+ hours of development education and application. While there I learned about about a ton including Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), E/R diagrams, and Integration Testing.

### Vending Machine Application
<img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20COMPLETE-%20green">
Developed command line vending machine application using Java. The program manages an inventory, dispenses change in coins, and keeps a sales log while practicing File I/O and OOP principles.

### TEnmo - Venmo style app
<img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20COMPLETE-%20green">
Developed money transfer application similar to Venmo using Java, PostgreSQL, and REST API design. The program resisters new users, requires login authentication, and transfers money between accounts.

### The Gaming Index - Video Game Database
<img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20COMPLETE-%20green">
Developed a video game database website using Java, PostgreSQL, REST API design, HTML, CSS, and the Vue framework. Our website's database's data is built from the IGDB.com database API. Our website allows users to search for games and find random games, add games to lists, allows users to rate games and comment on other users reviews.

## Side Projects
### Zombie Dice Game
<img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20IN%20PROGRESS-%20red">
Developing an application using Java. The program plays the tabletop game Zombie Dice, which is a classic my family plays when we don't want to spend an hour explaining the rules to someone new.

### Tournament Tracker Application
<img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20COMPLETE-%20green">
Developed a C#/ .NET application for tracking tournaments like college basketball's March Madness. The program creates and manages tournaments and teams. The application will send emails to update players on their next played game.
